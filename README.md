# spaceXData-UI

### About the app:

This is a frontend web application, aimed at providing User-Interface for the JSON data recieved from the `spaceXData API` for viewing JSON data, for filtering out the JSON data based on required filters and also providing responsive web app for all devices.

### App build-process:

1. Planning : 
 * First and most important step is about reading and knowing about the project your are going to work with,like `requirement specification` and deadline of the project etc. Then choose the `app-stack` that you are familiar with and appropriate for the project. After this setup a `development environment` for the project based on the project.
3. Designing :
 * Planning out the `UserInterface` for the project. Make a base plan and go on improvising as you build the project.
4. Implementation:
 * I choose the `React.js` framework for frontend development because i was familiar with it compared to other. Then I did lot of frontend programming using React.js framework for fetching and requesting `JSON data` recieved from `spaceXData API`. 
5. Testing : 
 * Usually I would write a piece of code for a particular component and do testing on it, to see whether it works or not like `Unit testing`. After I have completed whole project , then I go with `System testing`.  
6. Deployement :
 * As I was deploying in `Heroku`, I came to know that there is buildpack facility for deploying frontend app. `Buildpack` is a service in heroku which will look after backend stack in place of developer.
7. Maintaining :
 * For maintaining of application I created a github repo and placed my application in it. So that it would help in version controlling the application, as we go on updating the application.

   * In this page we view the Json data in a table. Some rows and cols in table view might be empty, if its there then use the json view as null values are not printed into the table cell.

   * In this a filter component will popup as we click on filter button. We can either select the values and filter out the data or close the filter component.

### Conclusion:

* This was an exiting project. I learnt many things while doing this project like Heroku deployment, react-bootstrap, working with external API's and some frontend logic.
